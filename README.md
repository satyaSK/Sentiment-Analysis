# Sentiment-Analysis
This repo would contain all the projects and exercises related to sentiment analysis. For a simple start, I have only implemented sentiment analysis with ANNs. I will soon be working on the LSTM(using RNNs and also more data) version, touching the more important details and real-world aspects of sentiment analysis in the near future as and when I get the time(I have less time nowadays, as my college work has resumed).
